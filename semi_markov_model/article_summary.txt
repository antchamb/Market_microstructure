Introduction

2 catégories de modélisation des actifs tick by tick:
	1- macro-to-micro: 
Prix observé = Noisy representation of unobserved price (e.g, semi martingale). 
Ici result exist on a robust estimation of the realized volatility.
problèmes: pas fou pour HFT
	2- micro to macro:
point processes (Hawkes processes)
focus on observable quantity

microstructure noise: HFT returns are anticorrelated, leading toa short term mean reversion effect
volatility cklustering: market alternates, independently of the intraday seasonaluty, between phases of high and low activity.

At large scale, price process ~ diffusion behavior

paper AIM: provide a tractable model of tick by ticj asset price for liquid asset
constant bid ask spread

Start: model free description of the piecewise constant mid price
(Tn, Jn)n 
Tn = jump times of the asset price associated to a counted process Nt
Jn = price incréments.

MRP = Markov RENEWAL pROCESS

nT + MODELS THE VOLATILITY CLUSTERING

mrp SEMI MARKOV PROPERTY: price process can be Embedded into a markov system with a few additional variabvles.

Section 2 = description of the MRP model + statistical estimation
Section 3: diffusive limit of the asset price at macrospocpic scale
Section 4: derive analytical formula for the mean signature plot
 and compare with real data.
Section 5;: conclusion + extension

Section 2:
means of a marked point process (Tn, Jn) = tick by tick fluctuation of a univariate stock price
Tn = sequence of jump times of the asset price
Jn = marks sequence calued in the finite set E ={+1, -1, … , +m, -m} C Z*
= price incréments

continous time price proces: Pt = P0 + sum(n=1 to Nt)(Jn), t>= 0
